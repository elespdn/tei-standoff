            <lb/>I am, that I have begun the history of 
            <lb/>myself in the way I have done; and
            <lb/>that I am able to go on tracing every 
            <lb/>thing in it, as <hi rend="ital"><persName>Horace</persName> says</hi>, <foreign rend="ital">ab Ovo</foreign>. </p>
         <p>
            <lb/><hi rend="ital"><persName>Horace</persName></hi>, I know, does not recommend 
            <lb/>this fashion altogether: But that gentle
            <lb break="no" rend="hyphen"/>man is speaking only of an epic poem or
            <lb/>a tragedy;-(I forget which)-besides, 
            <lb/>if it was not so, I should beg Mr. <hi rend="ital"><persName>Horace's</persName></hi>
            <lb/>pardon;-for in writing what I have set
            <lb/>about, I shall confine myself neither to
            <lb/>his rules, nor to any man's rules that ever
            <lb/><note resp="#LS">lived.</note> </p>
         <p>
            <lb/>To such, however, as do not choose to
            <lb/>go so far back into these things, I can
            <lb/>give no better advice, than that they
            <lb/>skip over the remaining part of this
            <lb/>Chapter; for I declare before hand, 'tis
            <pb/>
            <lb/>wrote only for the curious and inquisi <lb break="no" rend="hyphen"/>tive. </p>

            <lb/>-Shut the door.- <!-- Ah, the famous shut the door... only these aren't really em-dashes, are they? -->
            <lb/>I was begot in the night, betwixt the first
            <lb/><hi rend="ital">Sunday</hi> and the first <hi rend="ital">Monday</hi> in the month
            <lb/>of <hi rend="ital">March</hi>,in the year of our Lord one
            <lb/>thousand seven hundred and eighteen.
            <lb/>I am positive I was.-But how I came
            <lb/>to be so very particular in my account
            <lb/>of a thing which happened before I was
            <lb/>born, is owing to another small anecdonte
            <lb/>known only in our own family, but now
            <lb/>made public for the better clearing up
            <lb/>this point. </p>

            <lb/>off business for some years, in order to
