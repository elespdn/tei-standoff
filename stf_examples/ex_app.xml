         The first option is maybe better in the case where there are only <rdg> and not <lem>;
         also it seems easier to process; and it is more coherent with the other <stf>, where the target attribute is on the direct child.

      I tried to imagine a case for it, for example with overlapping apps for different categories of variation. 
      In the example below, app registering typographical variants and morphological variants are kept on two separate layers (so they can also overlap)-->

         we can just put in a footnote that overlapping apps, as any other overlapping structure, 
         should be kept in separate layers.
         What we need to put in the paper is an example of APP, a normal one, now on page 6 of the paper.
